## 🛑 Note on Lifecycle

Threads under `v2025.6` are proposals only until sealed.  
Only threads promoted to `main` and included in a runtime tag (e.g., `v2025.6-runtime`) are considered declared governance.

The `develop` branch is used for integration only and must not be used for enforcement or runtime binding.
